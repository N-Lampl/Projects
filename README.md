# ml-security-portfolio

> A data scientist's pivot into ML security: a CPU-only monorepo that **attacks _and_ defends** real
> ML systems — detection engineering, adversarial evasion, model privacy, LLM red-teaming, and ML
> supply-chain security — every project self-contained, reproducible, and grounded in
> **MITRE ATLAS / ATT&CK** and the **OWASP LLM Top 10**.

**Authorized use only.** Every technique here runs against models, data, and apps I own or am
licensed to test. See **[ETHICS.md](ETHICS.md)**.

**▶ Live Playground — attack these models in your browser.** The [`dashboard/`](dashboard/)
(React/Vite) opens with two interactive demos that run the **real trained models entirely
client-side** (no backend): a prompt-injection detector you can try to sneak past, and a fraud model
you can watch a fraudster evade — before the adversarially-hardened version shuts the attack down.
Weights are exported from the Python projects and the scoring math is reproduced in JavaScript to
~1e-6 parity. Below the Playground: headline before/after results, every project's metrics +
figures, and a build-on-this roadmap. See **[docs/PLAYGROUND.md](docs/PLAYGROUND.md)** for the story;
`cd dashboard && npm install && npm run dev` to run locally. Deploys to GitHub Pages.

## Why this repo exists

I'm a data scientist moving into a security-focused role. ML is my strength; this portfolio builds
the security half — the attacker mindset, the frameworks, and the defensive engineering — by
*doing*. Each project ships a strong README, a reproducible run (`make attack`), a committed
"money plot" + `metrics.json`, and a short interview story. Everything is built to run on a
**CPU-only laptop** (small models, pretrained targets, classical ML, data subsets, and API/small-Ollama
for LLMs).

## Project index

**45 projects across 8 tracks — all built, every one passing its fast test suite.** Each runs
**offline & deterministically** out of the box (synthetic data / mock LLM fallbacks); real datasets,
LLM API keys, or a GPU *enhance* specific projects but are never required to see them work.

The full rationale, 30-week learning roadmap, and scope decisions live in
[`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md). The interactive showcase **dashboard** (React/Vite) is the planned
final deliverable.

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1) (recommended) install uv — https://docs.astral.sh/uv/  — or just use system python3
make setup                      # ruff + pytest + pre-commit

# 2) run the seed project end-to-end (CPU, a couple of minutes)
cd 02-adversarial-robustness/p1-fgsm-mnist
make attack                     # trains a small MNIST CNN, runs FGSM, writes results/figures + metrics.json
```

Every project follows the **same skeleton** (`src/`, `scripts/`, `tests/`, `results/figures/`,
git-ignored `data/` + `models/`), so once you've read one you can read them all.

## Repo layout

```
00-foundations/        # security fundamentals as artifacts; every track links back here
01-detection-engineering/
02-adversarial-robustness/
03-ml-privacy/
04-llm-security/
05-ml-supply-chain/
06-financial-ml/
07-applied-nlp/        # applied NLP / data science (the ML strength the security half builds on)
docs/                  # ROADMAP.md, shared ATLAS/ATT&CK navigator layers, top-level plots
```

## Conventions

- **Reproducible:** every project pins deps and seeds RNGs (`set_seed(42)`); `make attack` regenerates
  the committed figure + `metrics.json`.
- **No data/weights in git:** datasets and model weights are downloaded by code (`src/data.py`,
  SHA-256 verified) and git-ignored. Only small figures + `metrics.json` are committed as evidence.
- **CI never trains:** GitHub Actions runs lint + fast smoke tests; heavy work is `@pytest.mark.slow`.
- **Ethics first:** see [ETHICS.md](ETHICS.md) and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## License

Code: [MIT](LICENSE). Datasets and pretrained weights retain their own licenses (see each
`data/README.md`).
