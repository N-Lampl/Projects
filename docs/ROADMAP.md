# Roadmap

> **Note:** the repository has since been curated down to **10 flagship projects**. The plan below
> reflects the original, broader roadmap and references projects that are no longer in the repo; it's
> kept as a record of the intended learning arc, not the current contents.

A ~30-week, phase-by-phase build order. Lead with the data-science strength (detection), build to the
attack-and-defend flagships, finish the most market-aligned work (LLM security) to highest polish.

| Phase | Weeks | Focus | Milestone |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0 - Foundations & scaffolding** | 1–4 (then ongoing) | Stand up the monorepo. Build the ONE canonical ATT&CK/ATLAS Navigator layer + authorization template every track reuses. Start Security+ SY0-701. | Repo public, coherent README, green CI, shared Navigator layer. Security+ study underway. |
| **1 - Detection engineering** | 4–9 | Lead with classical ML on security telemetry. Build the tabular IDS ONCE in `01-.../shared/ids_pipeline` and reuse it. Web-appsec + crypto modules in parallel evenings. | 4–5 polished detection repos with SOC metrics; the Sigma/detection-as-code project reframes you as a *detection engineer*. |
| **2 - Adversarial robustness + capstone** | 9–15 | Quick win first (FGSM-from-scratch done, then pretrained-Foolbox demo), building to the flagship: evade your OWN IDS under feature-mutability constraints → harden → re-measure. | Attack-and-defend-your-own-IDS flagship with a before/after robustness report card; one certified-defense depth piece. |
| **3 - LLM security** | 15–22 | API-first (cheap model), Ollama fallback. Build the vulnerable RAG target BEFORE attacking it. Add agent/tool-abuse + injection→tool-call→exfiltration. Land defend-the-RAG + CI-gated AppSec capstone. | End-to-end LLM AppSec story: threat-model → scan → build target → attack → defend (quantified ASR drop) → CI gate + dashboard + threat report. |
| **4 - Supply-chain + privacy** | 22–30 | Promote the supply-chain capstone (high MLSecOps hireability). Then privacy as depth; CPU-heavy LiRA/DP-SGD last as overnight batch. | Supply-chain capstone is a headline artifact; privacy rounds out depth. Security+ exam sat. |

## Extension beyond the original 30-week scope - ML depth (tracks 08–09)

The four phases above cover the security half. Tracks **07 applied-nlp**, **08 ml-depth**, and
**09 deep-learning** are the deliberate *other* half - the ML/DS strength the security work is
built on top of - added after the core roadmap. They carry the same engineering bar (self-contained
project, reproducible `make run`, committed figures + `metrics.json`, offline synthetic fallback,
CPU-only, green CI) but no forced security framing:

- **08 ml-depth** - causal inference (ATE via IPW/doubly-robust AIPW), Bayesian hierarchical
  modeling (from-scratch Gibbs sampler + calibration), graph neural networks (a pure-PyTorch GCN).
- **09 deep-learning** - transformer internals & mechanistic interpretability (induction heads,
  logit lens, activation patching), RL / RLHF (policy gradients + a reward-model-from-preferences
  pipeline), model compression & efficient inference (pruning, quantization, distillation).

These are not on the security critical path; they round out the portfolio as depth pieces.

## Final deliverable - showcase dashboard (build LAST)

After the projects exist, build an **interactive portfolio dashboard** as a **React/Vite SPA**,
deployed free on **GitHub Pages**. It should auto-discover each project (status from the track
READMEs, results from each `results/metrics.json` + `results/figures/*.png`) so it renders the
money plots and key metrics per project and maps them to MITRE ATLAS / OWASP LLM Top 10. This is
the capstone showcase / "click this link" interview artifact - intentionally built at the end, not now.

## Scope discipline (deliberately deferred)

- **No standalone foundations or poisoning track.** Foundations is consolidated in `00-foundations`;
  poisoning overlaps detection + RAG and its best pieces are CPU-heavy. Keep **BadNets + Neural-Cleanse
  (MNIST 10-class)** as an *optional stretch repo* if you finish early.
- **Depth-flex:** do **one** of certified randomized smoothing *or* full DP-SGD-across-budgets well.
- **CPU caps:** RobustBench eval = APGD-CE on ~50–100 images (cite leaderboard for full AutoAttack);
  LiRA reports TPR@1%FPR + AUC (not 0.1%); DP capstone = 2–3 ε points, shared shadow set, overnight batch.

## Pinned tooling (verified June 2026)

`adversarial-robustness-toolbox==1.20.1` · `torchattacks==3.5.1` · `foolbox` v3 · RobustBench from master ·
garak v0.15.x · PyRIT v0.14.x · promptfoo (MIT) · NeMo-Guardrails (`github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Guardrails`) ·
Opacus (`meta-pytorch/opacus`) · safetensors · `protectai/modelscan` · Sigstore Cosign.

## Dataset mirrors (official links flake - use these)

NSL-KDD + CICIDS2017 → dhoogla cleaned Kaggle CSVs · EMBER2018 v2 → dhoogla parquet (numpy memmap,
`num_threads<=4`) · PhiUSIIL → UCI #967 via `ucimlrepo` · LANL + LogHub (`logpai/loghub`) → stream-filter
to a labeled few-day slice; report precision@k, not ROC-AUC.
