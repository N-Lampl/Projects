"""Generate a consulting-style threat-model + remediation report (markdown).

The report is data-driven: it interpolates the actual gate results (per-OWASP
ASR, before/after) into a fixed consulting template (STRIDE-style threat table,
findings, prioritised remediations, residual risk). This is the deliverable a
